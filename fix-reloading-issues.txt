Based on my investigation, I've identified several potential causes for the page constantly reloading:

1. WorkCarousel useEffect issue:
   - The useEffect in WorkCarousel.tsx has an empty dependency array but uses the activeProject state
   - I've updated this with proper dependencies: [workItems, activeProject]

2. Twist N' Turn image swap issue:
   - The Twist N' Turn images are incorrectly assigned - I noticed twistBeforeImg and twistAfterImg got mixed up
   - Line 166-167 in WorkCarousel.tsx should be checked to ensure proper before/after assignment

3. The new-website.js script:
   - This external script from https://api.new.website/static/new-website.js might be causing reloads
   - It appears to be a visual editing tool that might be triggering refreshes for preview purposes

Possible solutions:

1. During development, you might want to temporarily comment out line 33 in index.astro:
   <!-- <script src="https://api.new.website/static/new-website.js"></script> -->
   
   This script is meant for the new.website visual editor but might be causing unnecessary reloads during development.

2. Check your Astro configuration to ensure hot reloading is set up correctly.

3. Fix the useEffect dependencies in WorkCarousel.tsx to prevent infinite render loops.

Let me know if these changes help resolve the reload issue!
